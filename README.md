# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Hello there.

If you're reading this, my name is Taj and I'm currently a sophomore (soon to be rising Junior as the semester comes to an end) at UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore-County). I'd say I'm still fairly new to coding, but I have experience developing in Java, C#, Unity, Python, HTML/CSS, and Processing3.
